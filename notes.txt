Github does not validate anyone just with thier email or password
It uses SSH key to validate a user

git branch -M main #switches to main branch 

git remote rename old_name to new new_name(most of the origin is used only)
example : git remote rename origin superman

git remote -u : this helps to avoid typing whole git push origin main... by setting up a upstream. Now just type git push to get the work done
